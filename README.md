## About the project
![Rain Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ondersumer07/weatherCard/master/static/demos/gif/rainDemo.gif)

This is a demo site's repository. You can clone this repo and adjust to your liking, or even build your website on top of it. It took a long time to adjust bits of this component, and I believe it was worth it. weatherCard utilizes [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), so you will need an API key from them. You can use their free plan if you plan on building a small project. Also, for the maps feature, you will need [Maps Static API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static) from Google.

## Built With

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Features

This component supports every possible weather condition mentioned in Open Weather API. It has 7 different animated backgrounds for various situations. Even if the title isn't directly supported, it's replaced by the most similar weather condition. Here are those animations:

Besides the weather condition, weatherCard also has a popup feature that shows the geographical location of your city. It uses Google's Maps Static API which is also customizable. You need to adjust your city name in the +page.server.js. You can find more detailed information about how to customize it in the documentation. Here's how the maps function work:
